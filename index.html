        <h3>Welcome to Vanilla</h3>

<p>Vanilla is a powerful LaTex preprocessor. It works based on the DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. It aims to reduce the entry barrier and the learning curve for Latex by simplifying the syntax and also reducing the verbosity of Latex. </p>

<h3>Technical Details</h3>

<p>Vanilla first started out as a separate markup language with a backward compatiblity to Latex. But it became apparent that there will be not enough interest in creating large amounts of libraries and productivity tools for Vanilla alone. So the authors departed from the idea and made it a preprocessor that incorporated a lot of features from their original markup language idea.</p>

<p>Any LaTex document is a valid Vanilla document but no Vanilla document is a valid LaTex document without being processed through the Vanilla. </p>

<p>The original compiler prototype was built using Matlab and then Python for more reachability. The preprocessor grew out of that compiler and was rewritten from scratch in Ruby and is shipped as a command line utility.</p>

<p>Vanilla builds on top of <strong>PDFLatex</strong>. So it is very important that you have any of the major Tex distributions installed on your computer.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>The repo comes with the documentation in a file called documentation.pdf.</p>
